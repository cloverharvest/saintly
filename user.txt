Saints Builder

I am a fourth grader at St. Dominic's.
I would like to know and study about saints.
Teacher says it is good to study their lives, be inspired by them and follow them as a good example.

I want to be able to show a collection of my favorite saints.
Each saint would show a picture.
What their name is.
Patron saint of what or who.
Feast day.
Their birthplace.
Brief life story.

I would also like to pull up a saint individually.

I would like to add more saints to it as I learn about each of them.

I would like to update or edit their information too.

I would like to be able to delete duplicate saint entries.

USER STORY(STRETCH):

In the future, I would like to be able to share with my classmates.

They can add a saint if it is still not in the builder.
